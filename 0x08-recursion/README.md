0x08-recursion
This subdirectory is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming repository. It contains a series of C programs demonstrating functionalities related to recursion, as part of an ALX project.

Files
Here's a brief description of each file in this directory:

0-puts_recursion.c: Prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.
1-print_rev_recursion.c: Prints a string in reverse using recursion.
2-strlen_recursion.c: Returns the length of a string using recursion.
3-factorial.c: Computes the factorial of a given number using recursion.
4-pow_recursion.c: Computes the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.
5-sqrt_recursion.c: Computes the natural square root of a number using recursion.
6-is_prime_number.c: Checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.
100-is_palindrome.c: Checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
101-wildcmp.c: Compares two strings and checks if they can be considered identical, with a special character '*' that can replace any string (including an empty string) using recursion.
The directory also includes:

main.h: A header file containing the function prototypes used in these programs.
_putchar.c: A file with the function _putchar that writes a character c to stdout.
